In this project we will be analyzing the No-Show Appointments dataset. The dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointments. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row and we need to find out the factors that are important in predicting whether a patient shows-up for the appointment or not. We seek answers to the following questions:

- Which gender is more committed to showing up for their appointments?
- Are older people more likely to miss/attend their appointments?
- Does scholarship (social welfare membership status) affect patient no-show?
- Are handicapped patients more likey to miss their appointments?
- Are there more no-show on certain days of the week?
- If a patient recevies a reminder SMS, is she/he more likely to attend the apointment?
- Does alochol problems affect patient attendance of their appointments?
- Do patients with chronic diseases (diabetes and hypertension) tend to miss appointments more or less than other patients?
- Which neighbourhoods have higher no-show proportions? and which have the lowest?
